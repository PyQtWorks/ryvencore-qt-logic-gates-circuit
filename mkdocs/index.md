# Welcome to the `ryvencore-qt` documentation!

Looking for a quick start? Visit the [Getting Started](../getting-started/) section.

## Project Idea

ryvencore-qt is an easy to use framework for creating based flow-based visual scripting editors for Python with Qt. The core concepts of [Ryven](https://github.com/leon-thomm/ryven) are now implemented in *ryvencore* (backend) and *ryvencore-qt* (frontend) and will be the base also for Ryven itself from now on.

!!! warning
    ryvencore-qt is not a professional piece of software and sometimes there are major changes. It is in very early stage, and be aware that future versions might not be fully backwards compatible. If you have suggestions for improvement of the software, feel free to open discussions.

Besides essential GUI classes, ryvencore-qt also provides a few convenience GUI classes which only use ryvencore's public API, making it a little easier to get started.

There is a precise definition of the fundamental characteristics of the flows in the [Features](features.md) section.

## Current State

In it's current state ryvencore-qt (as well as ryvencore) is still experimental. It works well so far and I will use it to create a few more specific visual scripting editors for Python. But it's pretty much in alpha state.

## Resources

May I also point to the [website of the Ryven project](https://ryven.org) if you haven't been there already. And there's a small [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfpqNAOXv35bj_j_E_OyR_A).
