Base directory of the library sources. 

### files

- `Design.py` manages the flow designs (themes, animations, performance mode etc.).
- `GlobalAttributes.py` stores some static information, currently just the package location after installation.
- The `GUIBase` is the base class for all frontend components and implements the `complete_data()` function to complete the data dicts from core components by adding all state defining data of frontend representations of those components. For example a `NodeItem` implements `complete_data()` to complete the data dict generated by its `Node` object and adds some fields like color, position in scene, display title etc.
- The `SessionThreadInterface` provides an abstraction to perform communication between the frontend thread (`FT`), and the core thread (`CT`), in case `FT != CT`. A frontend component can trigger method execution in `CT`  and get the method result in the same step by `SessionThreadInterface_Frontend.run()`. A backend component can do the same thing in the other direction by using the complementary `SessionThreadInterface_Backend.run()`.
- `tools.py` hosts some important functions that may be used in different places.

### packages

- `conv_gui` hosts some convenience GUI widget classes to quickly build a small editor with most basic features.
- `core_wrapper` is the `ryvencore-qt` wrapper of the core which adds some Qt signals to API some methods to enable threaded communication between frontend and core. These reimplementations defined in `core_wrapper` are stored in the core's `CLASSES` dict when the (wrapped) `Session` initializes.
- `flows` hosts all the GUI regarding flows and everything contained.
- `ryvencore` is the core.
